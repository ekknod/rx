/*
 * rx library, created by: github.com/ekknod
 *
 * features:
 *      process, library and input handling
 *
 * things what may need a future improvements:
 *
 *     - handle system, im not proud of how it works at this moment.
 *          reason: malloc used only for few variables
 *
 *     - input system
 *          reason: it's just not ready yet
 *
 *      - code cleaning
 *
